# Why I Can’t Just Meet You for Dinner

The conversation always goes the same way. Someone asks if I want to join them for a meal, grab a drink, go to the movies, or some perfectly reasonable social activity that healthy people do without thinking. And when I hesitate, or decline, or try to explain why a Tuesday evening gathering might not work when I’m working Wednesday morning, I can see it in their faces and hear it in their voices: they think I’m making excuses.
I’m not making excuses. I’m doing accounting.
What PEM Actually Is (And Why “Tired” Doesn’t Cut It)
Post-exertional malaise (PEM for those of us who live with it intimately) is not tiredness. It’s not even exhaustion. It’s a systemic crash that occurs after physical, cognitive, or emotional exertion that exceeds your body’s brutally reduced energy envelope.
Johns Hopkins Medicine defines PEM as “a delayed worsening of symptoms that occurs after minimal physical or mental activity.” The key feature, they note, is that “the malaise (extreme fatigue and flu-like symptoms) and other symptoms experienced are not in proportion to the amount of activity that has been done.”
Mayo Clinic describes it as “a flare in symptoms or the appearance of new symptoms after exertion, often manifesting after a characteristic 24-hour delay; however, 12 to 48 hours is common.” They note that it may take a person with ME/CFS “days, weeks, or even months to return to previous baseline after PEM.”
But these clinical definitions don’t capture what it actually feels like to live through.
Here’s what PEM looks like in practice:
The physical symptoms: Profound muscle weakness. That flu-feeling where your limbs are made of lead and your bones ache. Headaches. Dizziness. Worsened pain. The sensation that your body is running on a failing battery that won’t recharge no matter how much you rest.
The cognitive symptoms: Brain fog so thick you can’t follow a conversation or remember words for common objects. Difficulty processing information. Slower reaction times. The feeling that your thoughts are moving through molasses.
The autonomic symptoms: Heart palpitations. Temperature regulation failures (you’re freezing while sweating). Blood pressure problems. Orthostatic intolerance that makes standing up feel like running a marathon.
The timeline: This isn’t immediate. PEM typically hits 12 to 48 hours after the triggering activity. So Sunday’s 8-hour work shift becomes Tuesday’s complete inability to function. And you still have another 8-hour shift to work on Wednesday. The delay makes it invisible to onlookers and easy to dismiss as coincidence.
The duration: A PEM crash can last days, weeks, or even months. And here’s the cruel mathematics of it: the recovery time is almost never proportional to the triggering activity. Thirty minutes of light activity can cost you three days of function. That’s not an exchange rate any rational person would accept, but it’s the one we’re forced to work with.
The Accumulation Problem: What Too Much PEM Does to You
Here’s what most people don’t understand: PEM isn’t just a temporary setback. Frequent PEM crashes have compounding effects.
Every time you push through PEM (every time you ignore the warning signs and keep going because you have to work, or because someone is visiting, or because you’re trying to maintain some semblance of a normal life) you’re not just paying the price in the moment. You’re potentially worsening your baseline function permanently.
The research shows that repeated PEM episodes can lead to:
- Disease progression: Making your overall condition worse, not just temporarily but structurally
- Lowered baseline function: What used to be manageable becomes impossible
- Longer recovery times: The crashes get deeper and last longer
- New symptoms: Your body starts failing in ways it hadn’t before
- Decreased capacity: Your energy envelope (already devastatingly small) shrinks further
This is what the ME/CFS community calls a “crash and decline” pattern. And it’s why those of us who’ve been living with this for years become militant about pacing, about energy conservation, about saying no to things that healthy people do without thinking.
We’re not being dramatic. We’re trying not to permanently disable ourselves further.
How to Explain PEM to People Who Love You (But Don’t Get It)
This is the hardest part, isn’t it? Explaining to friends, family, partners why you can’t just “push through” or “try harder” or “think positive.” They see someone who looks fine (most of the time) declining invitations, skipping events, disappearing from social life. They don’t see the internal accounting that goes into every decision.
Start with the budget metaphor: I’ve found economic language helps people understand. Tell them you wake up with a certain amount of energy currency each day (let’s say 100 units). A healthy person might have 1,000 units. Everything costs energy: showering (10 units), getting dressed (5 units), making breakfast (8 units), driving to work (15 units). A single 8-hour work shift might cost you 300 units.
You’re already in a deficit by 200 units from your Sunday shift, and you have another 8-hour shift on Wednesday. That’s 600 units of work across two days in a week where you only have 700 total units (100 per day times 7 days). And you haven’t even counted the energy cost of getting ready for work, commuting, feeding yourself, or maintaining basic hygiene across those seven days. The math is impossible before you even consider having a life.
Emphasize the delayed payment: The true cost comes later. That Tuesday evening dinner seems manageable in the moment. You show up, you chat, you leave after an hour. It only cost 40 units. But Wednesday morning, when you wake up and can’t lift your head off the pillow, when your thinking is molasses and your muscles are screaming, that’s when you’re paying the real price. And you still have to go to work.
Describe what pushing through actually means: When healthy people “push through” tiredness, they’re tired afterward but recover quickly. When we push through PEM, we’re actively harming ourselves. It’s not building stamina or resilience. It’s more like running a marathon on a broken leg. You’re causing real, measurable damage that compounds over time.
Use specific examples from your life: Don’t speak in abstractions. Tell them about the time you went away for 2.5 days to celebrate your 30th anniversary and then spent weeks recovering from what should have been a joyful celebration. Tell them about the work shift that left you unable to drive yourself home safely. Tell them about the social gathering that seemed fine in the moment but cost you a week of function. Make it concrete.
Be explicit about the stakes: This isn’t about willpower or attitude. This is about disability management and harm reduction. You’re not declining their invitation because you don’t care about them. You’re declining because accepting might cost you the ability to work your next shift, or feed yourself tomorrow, or maintain the baseline function you desperately need to survive.
The Impossible Math of Working Part-Time with PEM
Let me tell you what working even a reduced schedule does to your social life when you have PEM: it obliterates it.
I work two days a week. Two. That’s it. And it consumes everything.
Here’s the math: I work Sunday. I spend Saturday preparing (resting, conserving energy, psyching myself up for the physical and cognitive demands of a retail shift). I work Sunday, running on fumes, assisting customers in an environment that can negatively impact healthy folks let alone someone with Long COVID and ME/CFS. The sounds, the lights, the standing, the walking, all pulling from my limited energy budget. At the end of the day I go home and crash. Monday, the crash deepens and builds from there. Tuesday, I’m still recovering if I’m lucky, or still crashed if I’m not. Wednesday, I work again. Thursday, Friday (you guessed it) recovering from Wednesday. And then Saturday rolls around again and I’m preparing for Sunday.
Where exactly in this schedule am I supposed to see friends? Go to social gatherings? Maintain relationships? Have a life?
The answer is: I don’t.
This is what people on the outside don’t understand. When they say “but you’re only working part-time,” they think that means you have all this free time. They don’t understand that the “free time” is actually recovery time. It’s not leisure. It’s not available for social activities or hobbies or the things that make life worth living. It’s medical necessity disguised as empty calendar space.
Every social invitation becomes a calculation: Can I afford this? What will it cost me? Will it interfere with work? Can I risk a crash that might cost me one of my two precious income-producing days?
Usually, the answer is no. The math doesn’t work out.
And this is with a part-time schedule. Imagine trying to work full-time with PEM. For many people with Long COVID and ME/CFS, it’s simply impossible. They try, they crash hard, and they often end up more disabled than when they started. The attempt to maintain employment (to keep participating in the economy, to avoid financial catastrophe) accelerates their decline.
The cruel irony is that working might be preventing the rest and pacing that could potentially improve their condition. But not working means poverty, loss of insurance, social isolation, and the complete erosion of identity that comes with losing your career. There’s no good choice here. Just impossible ones.
